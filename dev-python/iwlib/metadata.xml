		iwlib is a package for interfacing with iwlib, providing an implementation to the wireless tools in Linux.

		While very incomplete at the moment, it aims to eventually become a complete implementation, as features become necessary. If you find some functionality missing, feel free to contribute to the project, or create an issue on the bug tracker.

		Currently it provides what I consider the bare minimum to become useful - scanning, setting the ESSID of a device, and getting the current configuration back from a device.
