Greetings GitHub Users!
=======================

.. _bugs.funtoo.org: https://bugs.funtoo.org

If you are seeing this README file as part of the 'ports-2012' tree, then please
note that this is a 'delivery' Portage tree that is automatically generated and
used via ``emerge --sync`` to deliver tree updates to end-users. Don't file pull
requests against this tree -- we can't merge them.

If you are seeing this README as part of the 'funtoo-overlay' tree, then yes, we
can merge pull requests. Please open an associated bug at `bugs.funtoo.org`_ which
will be used to track progress on the pull request. (I will be working on automatic
integration of JIRA and GitHub, but this isn't done yet, so for now, please open
a Funtoo bug as well.)
