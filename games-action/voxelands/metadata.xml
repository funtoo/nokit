    Voxelands is a sandbox construction game based on Minetest, which was
 inspired by earlier "voxel world" games such as Infiniminer. Gameplay
 puts players in a fully destructible 3D game world where they can place
 and dig numerous types of blocks, items and creatures using a variety
 of tools. Inside the game world players can build structures, artworks
 and anything else their creativity can think of on multiplayer servers
 and singleplayer worlds across multiple game modes.
