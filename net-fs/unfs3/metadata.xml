	UNFS3 is a user-space implementation of the NFSv3 server specification. It
	provides a daemon for the MOUNT and NFS protocols, which are used by NFS
	clients for accessing files on the server. 

	UNFS3 supports all NFSv3 procedures with the exception of the READDIRPLUS
	procedure. It tries to provide as much information to NFS clients as
	possible, within the limits possible from user-space.

	See the unfsd(8) manpage for restrictions imposed on NFS operations (section
	RESTRICTIONS) and for possible races with local file system activity
	(section BUGS).

	It is not possible to export to netgroups or wildcard hostnames via
	/etc/exports, all other addressing methods should work. The following
	options are recognized in the exports file: ro, rw, root_squash, all_squash,
	no_root_squash, no_all_squash. If other options are present, they are
	ignored.

	Cluster extensions compatible to the older ClusterNFS project are supported
	when the source is configured with --enable-cluster.
